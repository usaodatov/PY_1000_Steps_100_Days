Personal Python Question Bank

Purpose
This repository is a comprehensive collection of Python coding exercises, inspired by challenges on platforms like HackerRank. It is designed to:
- Help learners systematically improve their Python skills.
- Serve as a resource for solving common programming problems.

The repository follows a structured approach with daily exercises. Each day's work is organized into separate folders (`DAY_1`, `DAY_2`, etc.), with 10 thoughtfully crafted coding problems. As the days progress, the problems become increasingly complex, moving from foundational concepts to advanced Python techniques.

Structure
Each folder (`DAY_1`, `DAY_2`, ...) contains:
- Problem Descriptions: Detailed problem statements, input/output formats, constraints, examples, and clues to solve.
- Code Implementation: Solutions in Python, including optimized approaches and step-by-step explanations in comments.

Problem Complexity Progression
- Day 1-7: Focus on Python basics like conditional statements, loops, strings, and simple list operations.
- Day 8-15: Introduce more advanced concepts like list comprehensions, set operations, and beginner-level algorithms.
- Day 16-25: Cover object-oriented programming (OOP), functional programming, and intermediate-level algorithmic problems.
- Day 26-32: Explore advanced topics such as regular expressions, data analysis with Pandas, web scraping, and debugging.
- Day 33-40: Dive deeper into data structures, including heaps, queues, stacks, linked lists, and trees.
- Day 41-50: Explore graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and mathematical problem-solving techniques.
- Day 51-60: Work on advanced algorithmic challenges, such as divide and conquer, backtracking, and greedy algorithms.
- Day 61-70: Solve real-world problems using APIs, JSON data handling, and modular Python programming.
- Day 71-80: Build skills in multiprocessing, multithreading, and asynchronous programming.
- Day 81-90: Focus on mini-projects, such as building a calculator, a weather app, or a basic game.
- Day 91-100: Complete larger projects integrating various concepts learned throughout the journey. Examples include data analysis pipelines, basic web development, or machine learning scripts.
