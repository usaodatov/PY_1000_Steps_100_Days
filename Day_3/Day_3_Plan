Day 3 Plan:

Key Topics to Cover (Layered Approach):

Advanced List Operations: Build on foundational list manipulations by introducing nested lists, list comprehensions, and unique problem-solving patterns (like two-pointer techniques).

Basic Algorithms: Focus on creating efficient solutions (e.g., second-largest number, array transformations).

Set Operations: Explore applications of set() for deduplication and intersections.

Logic Problems: Develop problem-solving skills by addressing challenges requiring multi-step reasoning.

Introductory Problem-Solving with Dictionaries: Lay the groundwork for advanced dictionary-based problems.



Purpose of Today's Plan:
Today, we are:

Building logical reasoning with moderately complex problems.
Adding tools (like sets and dictionaries) to handle unique constraints efficiently.
Practicing structured coding with reusable and well-commented functions.

Global Context:
Where We Are Within 1000 Steps:
Days 1-3 (Steps 1–30): Focus on mastering core Python fundamentals:

If-Else, Loops, Arithmetic, Basic List Manipulations.
Reinforcing logic with structured approaches.
Practice solving problems step-by-step and using hints where needed.
Next Layer (Days 4-10, Steps 31–100): Begin modular programming, improving efficiency, and learning libraries (e.g., itertools, collections). We'll introduce OOP concepts lightly by Day 8 or 9.

How Layers Build:
Each question today lays the foundation for:

Handling complex data structures later (Days 11-20).
Writing clean and optimized code for real-world problems.
Preparing for mini-projects starting around Day 20.
