Day 4: Session Introduction
Topics Covered Today:
Intermediate String Manipulations:

Reversals, transformations, and pattern matching.
Working with substrings and palindromes.
Comprehensions:

List, set, and dictionary comprehensions to write cleaner, more efficient code.
Advanced List Operations:

Merging, flattening nested lists, and splitting.
Set Applications:

Practical uses of sets for intersections, unions, and differences in problem-solving.
Algorithmic Thinking:

Combining loops, conditionals, and logic to solve complex problems step by step.
Objective of the Day:
Today, the focus is on:

Mastering string manipulations with real-world applications.
Understanding comprehensions to simplify your code.
Solving problems that require creative and efficient use of lists and sets.
Developing an algorithmic mindset to tackle challenges step by step.
By the end of the session, you'll be equipped with tools to write more concise and powerful Python code while applying these concepts to real-world problems.
